### Artist Profile:

**Choki Lindberg** creates meticulously crafted small-scale photographic sets that appear to be interior spaces but are actually miniature constructions. The work explores themes of:

- Memory and reconstruction
- Reality vs. artifice
- Decay and permanence
- Intimate interior spaces
- Constructed photography vs. documentary

### Technical Approach:

- Hand-built miniature sets
- Careful lighting construction
- Focus on texture and detail
- Each object deliberately placed
- "Working more like a painter or sculptor than a photographer"

- Two Parts Impossible, One Part May Be (2021) - Galerie Bart Amsterdam
- KunstRAI 2021 - Group presentation
- Elsewhere (2019) - Solo exhibition, Galerie Bart Amsterdam
