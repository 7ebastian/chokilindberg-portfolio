# ðŸš€ Getting Started - Choki Lindberg Portfolio

## âœ… Current Status

**Phase 1 Complete!** The foundation is set up and ready for AI-powered development:

### What's Working:

- âœ… Next.js 15 project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- âœ… Content parsing from your scraped JSON data (16 pages, 75 images)
- âœ… Navigation component with responsive mobile menu
- âœ… Design system based on your analysis (typography, colors, spacing)
- âœ… Homepage with hero image (`3_houses.jpg`)
- âœ… Project structure ready for rapid AI development

### File Structure Created:

```
chokilindberg-portfolio/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx (âœ… Navigation + SEO)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx (âœ… Homepage with hero)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ globals.css (âœ… Design system)
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Navigation.tsx (âœ… Responsive nav)
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ types.ts (âœ… TypeScript interfaces)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ content.ts (âœ… JSON parser)
â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ site-content.json (âœ… Your scraped data)
â””â”€â”€ public/
    â””â”€â”€ images/ (âœ… All 75 images copied)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps for AI Development

### 1. View Current Progress

The dev server should be running at `http://localhost:3000`

### 2. Create Core Pages (Week 1)

Use Cursor AI to rapidly build these pages:

**A. Work Portfolio Page (`/work`)**

```bash
# AI Prompt for Cursor:
"Create a portfolio grid page at app/work/page.tsx that:
- Uses getAllProjects() from @/lib/content
- Displays project thumbnails in a responsive grid
- Shows project title and year on hover
- Links to individual project pages
- Matches the minimal photography portfolio aesthetic"
```

**B. Individual Project Pages (`/work/[slug]`)**

```bash
# AI Prompt for Cursor:
"Create dynamic project pages at app/work/[slug]/page.tsx that:
- Uses getProjectBySlug() for data
- Displays image gallery with lightbox
- Shows project description and metadata
- Implements Next.js Image optimization
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop"
```

**C. About Page (`/about`)**

```bash
# AI Prompt for Cursor:
"Create an about page that uses getAboutPage() and displays:
- Artist statement with clean typography
- The quote about working like a painter/sculptor
- Professional, minimal layout"
```

### 3. Quick Development Commands

```bash
# Start development (if not running)
npm run dev

# View site
open http://localhost:3000

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel (when ready)
npx vercel
```

### 4. AI Development Tips

**Content is Ready!** Your scraped data is fully parsed and typed. Use these functions:

- `getAllProjects()` - Get all portfolio projects
- `getHomePage()` - Get homepage data
- `getAboutPage()` - Get about page content
- `getProjectBySlug(slug)` - Get specific project

**Design System Ready!** Use these Tailwind classes:

- `page-container` - Standard page layout
- `page-title` - Section headings
- `project-card` - Portfolio thumbnails
- `gallery-grid` - Image layouts

## ðŸ¤– Recommended AI Workflow

### Daily Pattern:

1. **Morning:** Choose one page/component to build
2. **AI Session:** Give Cursor specific, detailed prompts
3. **Test:** Check localhost:3000 immediately
4. **Iterate:** Refine with AI until perfect
5. **Commit:** Save progress to git

### Example AI Prompts:

```
"Build a responsive image gallery component for project pages that:
- Takes an array of ImageItem objects
- Uses Next.js Image with optimization
- Implements lightbox functionality
- Matches the minimal aesthetic
- Works on mobile and desktop"
```

## ðŸ“Š Current Content Available

Your scraped data includes:

- **16 complete pages** with content and metadata
- **22+ photography projects** from 2006-2021
- **75 high-res images** ready for optimization
- **Navigation structure** automatically parsed
- **SEO metadata** extracted and ready

## ðŸŽ¨ Design System in Place

The CSS includes:

- **Typography:** Clean, minimal hierarchy
- **Colors:** Black, white, grays (high contrast)
- **Spacing:** Generous whitespace for photography
- **Animations:** Subtle, professional transitions
- **Responsive:** Mobile-first approach

## âš¡ Performance Ready

Built-in optimizations:

- Next.js Image component for all photos
- Static generation for fast loading
- Tailwind for minimal CSS
- TypeScript for reliability

**Ready to "vibe code" with AI!** ðŸŽ‰

The foundation is solid. Now use Cursor to rapidly build beautiful, functional pages by leveraging your excellent content preparation.

**Next Action:** Open Cursor and start with the `/work` portfolio grid page!
