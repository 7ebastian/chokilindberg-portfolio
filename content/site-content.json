        "content": "Choki Lindberg’s photographs appear at first glance to depict interiors, often in a state of decay, void of human presence. The work is full of detail and fragmented stories. There are traces left behind, and we are invited to investigate and to associate freely. However, once we stop to study the details, an odd dimension surfaces. The proportions appear warped. Textures are exaggerated and there’s a clumsiness to the objects. And slowly the artifice begins to unravel.. What we see, are in fact meticulously crafted small-scale sets. Built by hand, every object is deliberately placed. The lighting carefully constructed.  It is a visual deceit, in a language of its own, that questions reality and our notions of permanence. “I work more like a painter or sculptor than a photographer - the image is constructed rather than capturing something existing, and working on a small scale gives me enormous freedom within very rigid confines. Building the models is full of limitations. Both the limit of the materials and the amount of detail possible, many things have to be altered and omitted, much like how we reconstruct it, each time we access a memory. Im more interested in how that memory felt, than how it “really was” The walls felt cool, or the flowers on the table seemed transparent.. that was what was important.. and so the process becomes a kind of boiling down to the essence of that moment, emotion or scene I’m trying to encompass. It is like a condensed reality, where new questions and meanings might be found.. “"

So Choki conducted her research from home, using Google Earth. The main criterion: “Houses that have seen something.” Zooming in further and further on the metropolitan anthill, she arrived at individual façades, behind which personal lives are led. Small worlds of their own that make up a part of the bigger whole.  Characteristic of the rest of her oeuvre, the houses that Choki picked out were meticulously recreated in miniature. What results from the slow creative process, whereby the artist carefully selects the right materials with which to render each detail as faithfully as possible, is stratification. But unlike her earlier work that contained a certain romantic or nostalgic undertone, this time, Choki photographs the houses against a stark white background. Stripped of their city context, the buildings drift in nothingness. A personal portrait without distraction or the house as an empty shell?  The nostalgia in this instance lies in the poignant sincerity of the images. But the hope that emanated from her previous series is now absent. “We humans are making a mistake. We aren't treating the planet with the respect it deserves. In that sense, I see a clear parallel with the times we are living in; we humans are a virus, too.” Whereas previously, the artist brought to our attention the beauty of decay and the overwhelming power of nature through the use of plants, here, there is not a trace of green to be found in this pared-down imagery. An alarming situation: have we reached the point where humans have definitively ruined nature?  Nonetheless, in the exhibition, Choki ties in the beauty of nature, this time found outside her own work. Empty anthills and wasps’ nests are given a podium as free-standing sculptures. As deserted as the isolated houses in her photos, they invite us to carefully examine and draw comparisons with our human behaviour. “At the end of the day, we’re all doing the same thing: living our lives\", says Choki. Whilst admiring the structures of the constructs, one cannot help notice a stifling sense of urgency come over one. Will we eventually leave the earth empty like these nests? Or is there still time for the tide to be turned?text: Merel van den Nieuwenhof"

In the yellow double salons of the embassy were, in the room on the right, Grand Salon - a large scale photograph depicting (a miniature model) of the salon itself after undergoing something of a transformation, the room  flooded and penetrated by plants, a blasted hole and scorched walls. In the salon on the left stood Please Wait here blending in with the existing furniture - a baroque chair - burnt and broken with plants growing out of it,  like a remnant of the fictive or potential catastrophe depicted in the photo on the opposite wall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Please Wait Here 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                \n                  \n                    View fullsize\n                  \n                  <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/506ab6e8e4b099c2648b250a/1548710475928-OELQ34HU0EKWQP60X9EN/PWH-1.jpg\" alt=\"PWH-1.jpg\" />\n                \n                \n              \n            \n          \n\n          \n        \n\n      \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                \n                  \n                    View fullsize\n                  \n                  <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/506ab6e8e4b099c2648b250a/1548710477033-KX4OSI1BKH1QQQ0EJ4RZ/PWH-2.jpg\" alt=\"PWH-2.jpg\" />\n                \n                \n              \n            \n          \n\n          \n        \n\n      \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                \n                  \n                    View fullsize\n                  \n                  <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/506ab6e8e4b099c2648b250a/1548710500334-HYLCBHV14HUJ6RY4KMG0/PWH-3.jpg\" alt=\"PWH-3.jpg\" />\n                \n                \n              \n            \n          \n\n          \n        \n\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#block-yui_3_17_2_1_1548684160967_16647 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -12px; }\n#block-yui_3_17_2_1_1548684160967_16647 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px; }\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Please Wait Here 2017 Chair, living plants, variable dimensions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        \n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          \n            Installation view Grand Salon photo: Rikke Luna & Matias © I DO ART Agency.\n          \n        \n      \n        \n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  Interview from the catalogue of ‘Carte Blanche’ by Natalia Gutman1) Your photograph depicts the actual space it is displayed in, but something dramatic has happened - can you describe the scenario?It’s unclear what exactly has happened, but one might imagine that a good deal of time has passed. There has been a fire. Murky water has flooded the space, plants have crept through the windows and walls have crumbled. There is no human presence to tell the story. It is all up to our imagination..2) The details in the photograph are hyper real, and at the same time it is a surreal scenario – could you explain how you create this effect?I build everything in miniature and then I photograph it. So you look at a highly detailed photograph, which you believe in, but then there is this shift in scale and a clumsiness that the miniature gives the objects, which reveals that it’s not real. I hope people can sense this disruption, while also being seduced by it. Almost everything is handmade. From the carved legs of the chairs, to cling foil wrapped wire that appears as glass ornaments in the chandelier. It’s quite a labour intensive way of producing a photograph. I use original materials wherever possible, for example, to fill a miniature sofa, I have split an old couch to get the filling. This in itself is something I enjoy, and I think you sense it in the work. I also hope people will take the time to engage, and immerse them selves in the image. The simple fact that time and effort has gone into making it, counters the speed that images are often produced with these days – I like this slow and meticulous process. 3) You have burnt off a painting, flooded the room and blasted a wall – the memento mori is inescapable? The desire to preserve and immortalize things can be obsessive.  It’s human to want to leave a mark on this world, but its delusional. Nothing, however solid and impressive it may appear, is permanent. High or low we are all a part of the same cycle. We have become so used to seeing disasters hit those who have the least, but what about this kind of environment. Maybe at some point none of us are going to be here, and a new and better species will evolve – who knows.4) Your other work is a piece entitled Please wait here – could you describe the character of the chair?The embassy environment has an air of opulence and times long passed, that makes it difficult to relate to. Everything is beautiful but stagnant somehow. The chair is a kind of response to that.The chair is in a state of extreme decay. At first glance it appears to be one of the chairs from the embassy, but on closer inspection, you will find subtle differences such as the shape, which is not quite right, and the upholstery which is not woven in the same pattern. The details give it away as an imposter, an outsider, leaving you to question its belonging and neglect."

The light is delicate, the door is open. There are traces in the details, tiny fragments of a story. The moment lingers, questions form.. The photographs in the series 'Interiors' appear at first glance to be images of settings chosen for their aesthetic appeal. There is, however, something unsettling and surreal about each image that entices us to spend time looking closer at the detail of the work and, as we do so, its artifice begins to unravel. Details and textures suddenly appear warped, leading us to question other elements of the scene, and ultimately revealing the images to be intricate constructions; What we see are in fact meticulously crafted small-scale sets.Chosen by Lindberg for their often highly personal content, these moments are re-constructed with careful attention to lighting, textures, colours and details - not as they were, but as she remembers them. We sense this privateness, and only little is revealed – leaving us to associate freely. As such, commenting on the subjective nature of perception and memory, and playing with the notions of photography’s (in)ability to represent reality.“I am interested in how we perceive things.

dilapidated and overgrown. Human presence is a thing of the past and has made way for nature. Who once lived here, read books here, sat around the dinner table talking until late at night and went out through the door that is still standing open?  The photographs of Choki Lindberg (b. 1979, Copenhagen) evoke a sense of recognition. A variation of that wallpaper, those chairs or that desk lamp might be in your own home, or you could be familiar with them from other people’s homes. A perfectly ordinary setting placed outside of ordinary reality. For we seldom get to see a destroyed home in such detail; we generally knock such places down in order to make way for something new. Lindberg’s work gives you a peek at it, allowing you to absorb both the tragedy and beauty of decay. When you look a little longer at these photographs, something about them seems a little odd. And then you realize that these are not real interiors of existing homes. Lindberg builds small-scale sets that she photographs. This gives her work a surrealistic touch. Despite the staging, however, she uses ‘real’ things as much as possible. ‘For the overgrowth, I look for very tiny plants that are convincing proportion-wise. When I make a miniature chair, I use the stuffing from the seat of an old armchair. And if I want a window to offer a view of the sea, I take my scale model to the coast and make the photograph there.’The combination of the medium of photography and meticulously constructed settings gives a feeling of authenticity. We implicitly believe in the existence of these places, after which our imagination fills in the stories that go with them. The concentration demanded by the slow process of making a photograph – a reaction to today’s high-speed photography – is reflected in the concentration with which we examine it. Scanning a precisely furnished room with our eyes, we momentarily come to a standstill in a small world that could depict the present, the past or a near future; a world that is crumbling away as a result of some incident, or simply because of the ravages of time.  ‘When a catastrophe happens elsewhere, we take comfort in the thought that it is far away, often in a poverty-stricken part of the world. But elsewhere can also be here, in the present or in another time. That’s why my photographs often have something timeless or nostalgic about them,’ says Lindberg. She is fascinated by the traces we leave behind as human beings. ‘I like to think of what the world will look like after humanity is extinct. That sounds melancholic, but there is also an aspect of beauty to it: decay is followed by renewal. When we are no longer around and what has been made by human hands gradually disappears, the strong will survive: the plants growing up between the boards of the parquet floor and the tree in the stairwell.’text: Merel van den Nieuwenhof"
