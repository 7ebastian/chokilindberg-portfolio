## 🧹 Critical Maintenance: Directory Organization ✅ FIXED (Jan 2025)

### Issue Resolved: Duplicate Directory Structure

**Problem:** Dangerous duplication of directories causing confusion:

- Root level `/app/` directory (duplicate)
- Actual project `/chokilindberg-portfolio/app/` (real Next.js app)

**Solution Implemented:**

- [x] Removed duplicate `/app/` directory at root level
- [x] Established single source of truth: `/chokilindberg-portfolio/`
- [x] Created comprehensive directory organization rules (`.cursor/rules/004-directory-duplication-prevention.mdc`)
- [x] Added quick reference guide (`.cursor/DIRECTORY_RULES.md`)
- [x] Implemented prevention protocols for AI development workflows

**Key Rules Established:**

- **Single Source of Truth:** All website code ONLY in `/chokilindberg-portfolio/`
- **Clear Purpose Separation:** Documentation at root, functionality in project
- **AI Integration Rules:** Always specify absolute paths, reject duplicate suggestions
- **Prevention Checklist:** 3-step verification before creating any directory

**Impact:** Eliminates #1 development confusion source, prevents future duplicate directory creation, ensures clean project structure for deployment.
